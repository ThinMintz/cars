<h1>Cars, the Chihuahua</h1>


<p> Did you think you were going to have a website about automobiles? WRONG! This is about Cars the Chihuahua! He is a very good boy, who tries to very hard to keep the house free of robbers and mailmen.  Does he bark at everyone that comes to the house? Maybe, but how else will he keep everyone away?<p>
